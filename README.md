# LoginDemo

A sample of an Android app following an MVP architecture.

Techonologies used:
- Kotlin
- Retrofit
- Android Studio 3.1.2

The purpose of this project is to suggest and expose a simple way to organize and structure an Android app with an efficient approach to SoC and code reusability.

###### Note: you might find unused functions and variables as this is just a piece extracted from an ongoing project
